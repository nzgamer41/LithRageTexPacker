# LithRageTexPacker
This tool takes in a 256-color BMP file and converts it to the .BIN format used on Monolith Productions' RAGE engine, primarily used on the Microsoft Windows 95 Game Sampler and Game Sampler 2 CDs.

## Requirements
.NET 8.0

## Usage
Compile the EXE, and run it from command line with the BMP file as the first argument and the GLOBAL.PAL file you've extracted from your .REZ file (like ODYSSEY.REZ for Game Sampler 2) as the second argument.
